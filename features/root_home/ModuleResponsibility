 Do not use two navigation components such as bottom navigation with drawer
 ,with the same screen.
 since the a screen/module may have it own navigation graph or hierarchy
 so be careful to use  call a screen as a content parameter of the drawer decorator,
 example as:
 DrawerDecorator(
 ...
 content=X
 )
 it is possible that X may have it own navigation component such as bottom
 navigation,in that case X have to navigation component one is the drawer and
 other is the bottom navigation,it not recommended to use.
 to avoid that pass only those screen as  content parameter of the drawer that
 has not other navigation component,if the screen may have navigation component
 in that case instead of calling it as drawer decorator content,just navigate to it by pushing
 into a back stack.
