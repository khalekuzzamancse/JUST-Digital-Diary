It will show the list of faculties:
   The list are itself is destination.these destination can be shown by either using a drawer
   or something else.
   Ways of showing destinations:
   1.Bottom navigation
   2.Modal drawer
   3.
   destinations>5 ,so options 1 is not valid.
   There are already a top level navigation drawer,using another navigation drawer may not be the
   best approach because the concept of navigation drawer says,
   it will always show the top level destination what ever screen is it is.using the child modal drawer
   will hide the top level drawer in some screen.
   at this moment i do not have any better solution,at based on the requirement the UI may needed to
   update,so design this module such as way so that the other module or it dependent modules
   does not affect,it the UI of this module is changed.

 What about Bottom Sheets:
 Bottom Sheets are used for supplement content or actions ,not for destinations.
 however is the bottom sheet you are allowed to represent list or grid or any types of layout.
 so if we going to use the destination as a list then you can use the list in the bottom sheet
 if you want.

 Navigation Drawer:
 Used for if we have more level of nested hierarchy.
 it is used for switching between two unrelated destination quickly.
 Do not use two navigation components such as bottom navigation with drawer
 ,with the same screen.
