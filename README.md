## INTRODUCTION

<!---
Briefly describe what the problem it solve 
-->
<p align=" justify" >
 Disaster Information System is a  Multiplatform application.It is being developed using Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform technology.

The existing information about various disasters is not readily available at the user level, and it lacks proper maintenance and analysis. To address this challenge, the Disaster Information System aims to collect information related to recently occurred disasters. This information is presented in various formats, including text, video, and images.
</p>

### Project Scope and Assumptions
<p align=" justify" >
This project is intended for use with a high-speed internet connection and requires devices that support Google Maps, location permissions, and device media access permissions.
